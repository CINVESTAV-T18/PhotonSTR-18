# PhotonSTR-18PhotonSTR-19
The objective of this program is the statistical analysis of processes that vary over time. 
PhotonSTR-T18 is capable of handling large data batches of scattered photon history and calculate not only the intensity correlation and structure functions in auto-mode but, from two independent channels, also in the cross mode of two channels. 

Getting Started
These instructions describe how to get a copy of the project and run it on a local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
Since this program is developed in LabVIEW2017, it can run in any operative system capable of running this versión of LabVIEW; nevertheless, it is preferable to run in a computer with more or equal to 8Gb of RAM.

Installing
To install this program, copy the project placed in the Software X Repository, in a folder on a computer with labview installed, and execute the file: Photon-STR18.vi 

Running a test
1) Start the Vi.
2) Set the parameters and operation mode.
3) Select Open File
4) From the pop-up menu, select the file(s) to operate.
5) When the program finishes the computation of the data, it asks to the user if he wants to save the output. If the user answer yes, then he must select the location and the name of the file to be created. 
Even if the user selects no, he can save the last generated data with the save button.
6) The correlation and structure function will be presented in the graphs at the bottom of the main window, as shown next.
 
We provide a calibration data archive to test the output of this program called: "t100sA.dat"
